                                I and my team had to make MVP bank video call service. I implemented front-end and back-end core of the video calls service.

                                I had to choose more convenient tool for video call creating and learn all needed information. It was WebRTC and one of the popular WebRTC framework – Voximplant. I realized users query service for manage limited call connections. After the successful launch of the project I developed and supported front-end part of the service.

                                I created a desktop application for Windows for advertising on various social networks and advertising platforms (inst, fb, vk, kufar, avito).
                                My program consisted of two parts. Frontend and backend. The first was an ad builder based on the ZennoPoster tool. Made a single interface for automatically placed ads on websites. I made a very flexible system in which the user could create a JSON file in which a lot of advertising settings can be specified (publish time, platforms, images, watermarks, etc.)

                                The user can also monitor the execution of the program, stop and continue manually. I also used services to overcome the captcha difference posting limitation. The second part was a web-based dashboard that collected all the information about the ad (likes, customer messages, views). The user could also open a chat with a specific client.
