                                My program consisted of two parts. Frontend and backend. The first was an ad builder based on the ZennoPoster tool. Made a single interface for automatically placed ads on websites. I made a very flexible system in which the user could create a JSON file in which a lot of advertising settings can be specified (publish time, platforms, images, watermarks, etc.)

                                The user can also monitor the execution of the program, stop and continue manually. I also used services to overcome the captcha difference posting limitation. The second part was a web-based dashboard that collected all the information about the ad (likes, customer messages, views). The user could also open a chat with a specific client.
